# Cured Pork: An Immunization Datapack for Piglins

This is a "vanilla-plus" datapack which allows the player to "immunize"
piglins from being zombified by giving them **enchanted golden apples.**

## How It Works

[Piglins](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Piglin#Zombification)
who travel to the Overworld of The End will normally zombify after
15 seconds _unless_ they have the NBT tag `IsImmuneToZombification` with
a value of `true`.

This datapack runs a command every second that searches for any piglin
(or piglin brute*) that is holding an enchanted golden apple and gives
them that tag.

_*if you can figure out how to get the brute to pick up the apple_

## Why Would I Want This?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ That's your business.

Maybe you want to have a piglin bartering station in the overworld.

Maybe you're trying to cheese your way to collecting a piglin head.

Maybe you're trying to create a menagerie and are finding it difficult
to keep your dolphins alive in the Nether.

Maybe you're doing some _Star Trek_ roleplay and want a
[Tellarite](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tellarite)
on your bridge crew.

## Compatibility

This datapack has been tested on versions:

- [x] 1.20.4
- [x] 24w07a
- [x] 1.16.2

and should work on all versions in between.
